#Cleanup

A python utility script that moves all files and folders on the desktop to a new, time-stamped directory within the Documents folder. This can be run from *any* directory; only the files on the Desktop will be moved.

For information on how to make a python file globally executable, see the README [here](https://github.com/jeffreysbrother/spaces).
